# Distribution Algorithm for Digital Assets 

This project has as main goal exploring an Ethereum Application to execute multiple in-series accounting/statement processes simultaneously across trustless networks, while maintaining privacy for users. The system is conceived as a ledger of transactions that1 retrieves payments distributed by Smart Contracts. 

For developer guidance, the project has the main following development important files:

-The server to connect the endpoints(a bridge of communication between the front end and the controllers that communicate directly with the Ethereum).

-The Smart Contracts are files that define several actions over the blockchain. For example: the distribution of the shares each participant gets,the creation of assets, participants, and transactions, complex logic processes such as queries for audit searches.

-The front end uses react, redux and d3 for showing to the user the features of the project.


# Structure of the Project
react-app: This folder is a small app in React for showing the distribution tree diagrams with d3 in react environment
ethereum-node-server: this is the replication of the algorithm of hyperledger composer research but more simple and in ethereum
